# MD Previewer
Check it out: https://mdpreviewer.lirondc.com/

This is another "hour project" I made before dinner. It's a classic markdown previewer with responsive design and small animations for buttons and tooltips. You can also maximize one window and then minimize it again. Challenge courtesy of FreeCodeCamp.

Added optional feature: creates a `<br>` when the enter key is pressed.
Added security feature: employes dompurify to sanitize against XSS attacks.

Technologies Used:
- React
- TypeScript
- CSS
- HTML
- MaterialUI
- DOMPurify
- MarkedJS
